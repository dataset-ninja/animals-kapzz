**Animals Computer Vision Project** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the tourism industry.

The dataset consists of 947 images with 8861 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *Giraffe*, *Elephant*, and *Zebra*.

Each image in the Animals (kapzz) dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *valid* (82 images) and *train* (865 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/).
